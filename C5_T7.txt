Step 1: Build model
Part A
In this step, you'll build and train your first model with gradient boosting.

Begin by setting my_model_1 to an XGBoost model. Use the XGBRegressor class, and set the random seed to 0 (random_state=0). Leave all other parameters as default.
Then, fit the model to the training data in X_train and y_train.

from xgboost import XGBRegressor
​
# Define the model
my_model_1 = XGBRegressor(random_state = 0) # Your code here
​
# Fit the model
my_model_1.fit(X_train,y_train) # Your code here
​
# Check your answer
step_1.a.check()
Correct

Part B
Set predictions_1 to the model's predictions for the validation data. Recall that the validation features are stored in X_valid.

from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
​
# Get predictions
predictions_1 = my_model_1.predict(X_valid) # Your code here

# Check your answer

Correct

Part C
Finally, use the mean_absolute_error() function to calculate the mean absolute error (MAE) corresponding to the predictions for the validation set. Recall that the labels for the validation data are stored in y_valid.

mae_1 = mean_absolute_error(predictions_1, y_valid)
print("Mean Absolute Error:" , mae_1)
# Check your answer
step_1.c.check()
# Calculate MAE
# Calculate MAE
mae_1 = mean_absolute_error(predictions_1, y_valid) # Your code here
​
# Uncomment to print MAE
print("Mean Absolute Error:" , mae_1)
​
# Check your answer
step_1.c.check()
Mean Absolute Error: 17662.736729452055
Correct

Step 2: Improve the model
Now that you've trained a default model as baseline, it's time to tinker with the parameters, to see if you can get better performance!

Begin by setting my_model_2 to an XGBoost model, using the XGBRegressor class. Use what you learned in the previous tutorial to figure out how to change the default parameters (like n_estimators and learning_rate) to get better results.
Then, fit the model to the training data in X_train and y_train.
Set predictions_2 to the model's predictions for the validation data. Recall that the validation features are stored in X_valid.
Finally, use the mean_absolute_error() function to calculate the mean absolute error (MAE) corresponding to the predictions on the validation set. Recall that the labels for the validation data are stored in y_valid.
In order for this step to be marked correct, your model in my_model_2 must attain lower MAE than the model in my_model_1.

add Codeadd Markdown
# Define the model
my_model_2 = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=10000, learning_rate=0.05, n_jobs=4)
my_model_2.fit(X_train, y_train, 
             early_stopping_rounds=5, 
             eval_set=[(X_valid, y_valid)], 
             verbose=True)

# Get predictions
predictions_2 = my_model_2.predict(X_valid)

# Calculate MAE
mae_2 = mean_absolute_error(predictions_2, y_valid)
print("Mean Absolute Error:" , mae_2)
my_model_2 = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=1000, learning_rate=0.05, n_jobs=-1) # Your code here
​
# Fit the model
my_model_2.fit(X_train, y_train) # Your code here
​
# Get predictions
predictions_2 = my_model_2.predict(X_valid) # Your code here
​
# Calculate MAE
mae_2 = mean_absolute_error(predictions_2, y_valid) # Your code here
​
# Uncomment to print MAE
print("Mean Absolute Error:" , mae_2)
​
# Check your answer
step_2.check()
Mean Absolute Error: 16688.691513270547
Correct

Step 3: Break the model
In this step, you will create a model that performs worse than the original model in Step 1. This will help you to develop your intuition for how to set parameters. You might even find that you accidentally get better performance, which is ultimately a nice problem to have and a valuable learning experience!

Begin by setting my_model_3 to an XGBoost model, using the XGBRegressor class. Use what you learned in the previous tutorial to figure out how to change the default parameters (like n_estimators and learning_rate) to design a model to get high MAE.
Then, fit the model to the training data in X_train and y_train.
Set predictions_3 to the model's predictions for the validation data. Recall that the validation features are stored in X_valid.
Finally, use the mean_absolute_error() function to calculate the mean absolute error (MAE) corresponding to the predictions on the validation set. Recall that the labels for the validation data are stored in y_valid.
In order for this step to be marked correct, your model in my_model_3 must attain higher MAE than the model in my_model_1.

# Define the model
my_model_3 = XGBRegressor(n_estimators=1)
​
# Fit the model
my_model_3.fit(X_train, y_train)
​
# Get predictions
predictions_3 = my_model_3.predict(X_valid)
​
# Calculate MAE
mae_3 = mean_absolute_error(predictions_3, y_valid)
print("Mean Absolute Error:" , mae_3)
Mean Absolute Error: 127895.0828807256

Continue to learn about data leakage. This is an important issue for a data scientist to understand, and it has the potential to ruin your models in subtle and dangerous ways!
